You can get a lot of embedded processing power for a euro these days.

An ARM Cortex-M0-based STM32F030 costs €1.11[^1] and has approximately the computing power of a 1994-era 486 costing about €416[^2].

[Cifra][cifra] is my collection of cryptography primitives in standard C, targetted towards small embedded devices.
How does modern authenticated encryption run on such devices?

# AES128-GCM

# AES128-EAX

# AES128-CCM

# NORX32-4-1

[Norx][norx] is a very new AEAD algorithm with flavours of Salsa/ChaCha (the core permutation) and Keccak (the sponge structure).  It's a candidate for the [CAESAR][caesar] competition.

The notation `NORX32-4-1` means an instance of NORX using 32-bit words, 4 rounds and no parallelisation.
One NORX round is worth two Salsa/ChaCha rounds, so this is about the same as ChaCha8.
You can expect this to have a lower security bound than ChaCha20, but also be about 2.5 times quicker.

# ChaCha20-Poly1305

This is a construction recently standardised in [RFC7539][rfc7539], glueing together the ChaCha20 stream cipher and Poly1305 one-time MAC to give a general purpose AEAD scheme.
