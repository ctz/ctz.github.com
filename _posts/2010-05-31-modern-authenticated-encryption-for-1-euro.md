You can get a lot of embedded processing power for a euro these days.
A STM32F030 costs €1.11[^1] and has about the computational power of a 1994-era 486 costing about €20[^2].

[Cifra][cifra] is my collection of cryptography primitives in standard C, targetted towards small embedded devices.
How does modern authenticated encryption run on such devices?
