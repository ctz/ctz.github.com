Let's assume for a moment you are an IoT company like Nest, with control[^1] of a chunk of devices which use up energy.  The more energy at your behest, the better: HVAC, refridgerators and electric heating are excellent choices.

Your business model is probably a mix of hardware sales and cloud services.  But you're missing a trick: you should also capitalise on your extant control of energy demand.  Here's how:

1. Buy electricity options.
2. Spike demand by increasing power demand for a few minutes.
3. *Sell sell sell!*

This is obviously risky, unethical, and perhaps illegal.  But the IoT is *all about* disregarding risks. The financial services industry are typically comfortable with the other downsides, so you may wish to partner with a trading company.

You might also have a good idea of where your users are in relation to the power consuming equipment you control: this allows you to minimise the chances of your users will notice.

[^1]: Direct or indirect. It doesn't much matter if they can control things remotely, or can sign a firmware update to add that capability.
